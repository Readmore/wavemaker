== Application Layout

=== Git as a DB
The class GitRecord (found at app/model/git_record.rb) is an interface for using Git as a 
key-value store within Rails. All data objects inherit from GitRecord instead of ActiveRecord
in this application. 


=== User Data

All user created data is stored in the db directory under the current environment and their username.
For example, the development data for the user brandon would be stored here:

   $ db/development/brandon

Every user has their own git repository so their data can, at any time, be downloaded from the server
and operate as an independent git repo.
